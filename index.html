            <ul>
                <li class="problem-list">Cyberpsychosis is a mental illness which is triggered by excessive utilization of cybernetic augmentation causing the victim to lose their grip on reality and to lose their sense of identity as a person. This ultimately transforms them into dangerous and unpredictable entities who begin to view other human beings and living things as inferior.</li>
            </ul>
                <h2 style="color:black;">Symptoms</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="problem-list">A person infected by cyberpsychosis has gradual symptoms, ranging from decay of self preservation, distancing and breaking contacts with friends and family, need for self isolation and development of an impulsive nature</li>
            </ul>
                <h2 style="color:black;">Causes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="problem-list">Over usage of augmented reality causing the person to not be able to differentiate between reality and the fake world created by AR, ultimately leading the person to lose control over his senses.</li>

            <p>We at Seraphic have come up with a new and innovative solution to counter this rapid spread of ‘cyberpsychosis’. We have developed a series of devices called ‘seraphs’. These seraphs may look like normal objects that one may find in their back pocket, but they are completely different from their usage, in fact they are opposite.</p>
            <p>When engulfed in a AR virtual reality, our seraphs help people to distinguish between the reality and the fake world created by the AR by performing their real function. This helps people recognize the world they are in and prevent them from overusing the AR, hence reducing the possibility of getting diagnosed with cyberpsychosis.</p>
            <p>For example one of our products the SouthSeeker appears to look like a normal compass, however its needle always points towards the south. When the user is in an AR world, the AR would interpret the compass as a normal one, with the compass pointing towards the north. This would help the user to distinguish between the two realities, hence making the user aware. This would highly reduce the rate of ‘cyberpsychosis’ as people would be able to differentiate between the two worlds.</p>
